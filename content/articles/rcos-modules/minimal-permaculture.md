## Minimal Permaculture Module

The Minimal Permaculture Module is an optional, lightweight module designed for **small or early-stage communities** that want ecological grounding without the complexity, labor intensity, or expertise requirements of full permaculture systems.

It prioritizes:
- Simplicity over optimization
- Learnability over completeness
- Low coordination overhead
- Immediate resilience benefits

### What This Module Is

This module provides:
- A minimal shared ecological baseline
- Clear boundaries between personal and collective land use
- Simple stewardship rules for soil, water, and biomass
- Enough structure to prevent ecological degradation

It is intentionally **not a full permaculture design system**.

### What This Module Is Not

This module is not:
- A certification standard
- A complete food system
- A replacement for professional permaculture design
- A productivity-maximization framework

It does not assume:
- Large land areas
- Full-time farmers
- High yields
- Deep technical knowledge

### When to Use the Minimal Permaculture Module

This module is well-suited when:
- The community is under ~20 people
- Land area is small or fragmented
- Members have limited time or experience
- The community is still stabilizing governance and operations
- Food production is partial, not primary

It is especially useful for:
- New intentional communities
- Urban or peri-urban projects
- Transitional or experimental communities
- Communities renting or leasing land

### For Whom This Module Is Designed

This module is designed for:
- Communities that want ecological alignment without overwhelm
- Groups prioritizing social stability first
- Communities with mixed skill levels
- Projects where land is shared but lightly managed

### Core Focus Areas

Typical focus areas include:
- Soil protection (no extraction-only use)
- Basic composting or biomass cycling
- Water awareness and conservation
- Clear stewardship responsibility
- Avoidance of ecological debt

### Relationship to RCOS

This module:
- Extends RCOS Layer 3 (Commons & Resources)
- Interfaces with Layer 5 (Operations)
- May introduce optional stewardship roles
- Does not alter Layer 0 purpose unless explicitly adopted

Communities may later migrate from this module to a full Permaculture Module without structural conflict.
