## Permaculture Module (Non-Normative)

This module defines how a community MAY integrate permaculture principles and practices into an RCOS-aligned structure.

The Permaculture Module governs **structure, authority, and accountability** around ecological systems.  
It does NOT prescribe belief systems, lifestyles, moral hierarchies, or agricultural techniques.

This module is optional and MUST NOT override RCOS Core invariants.

---

## Purpose & Scope

### Purpose

To enable regenerative land use and food systems while preventing:
- informal land ownership through caretaking,
- hidden or coerced ecological labor,
- ideological capture of governance via “ecological correctness,”
- irreversible structural commitments disguised as sustainability.

### Scope

This module applies only to:
- land use and stewardship,
- food and material production systems,
- ecological infrastructure,
- associated labor, roles, and decision authority.

It explicitly does NOT govern:
- personal dietary choices,
- spiritual or ethical belief systems,
- informal gardening or hobby activity outside governed scope.

---

## Non-Goals (Explicit)

This module does NOT:
- enforce permaculture ideology,
- define “correct” ecological methods,
- grant moral authority to ecological expertise,
- require ecological participation as identity validation.

Ecology is treated as **infrastructure**, not belief.

---

## Design Constraints (Hard)

When this module is active:

- Ecological authority MUST be reviewable.
- Ecological labor MUST be legible.
- Ecological systems MUST remain exitable.
- Ecological expertise MUST NOT convert into governance power.

Failure to uphold these constraints constitutes a structural violation.

---

## Land & Resource Classification

### Governed Ecological Scope

The community MUST explicitly define which land and systems fall under this module.

For each governed ecological area or system, the following MUST be declared:
- classification (commons, stewarded commons, private),
- allowed and prohibited activities,
- decision authority,
- review and reclassification mechanism.

Unclassified land or systems MUST NOT be governed by this module.

---

### Commons Protection

Land or systems classified as commons:
- MUST NOT be privatized through use, care, or investment,
- MUST NOT be controlled indefinitely by individuals or families,
- MUST have explicit exit and reassignment rules.

No amount of labor, expertise, or historical contribution grants ownership by default.

---

## Stewardship Roles

### Role Definition

All ongoing ecological responsibilities MUST be assigned to explicit roles.

Each stewardship role MUST define:
- scope and limits of authority,
- decision interfaces with Layer 2 governance,
- term length and review cadence,
- handover and succession process,
- failure and removal conditions.

No ecological responsibility MAY exist outside a role.

---

### Anti-Capture Constraint

A stewardship role:
- MUST NOT control both ecological systems AND governance authority,
- MUST NOT accumulate unreviewed scope,
- MUST NOT become irreplaceable through undocumented knowledge.

Violation triggers mandatory review.

---

## Decision Authority & Expertise

### Authority Mapping

Ecological decisions MUST be mapped to RCOS decision types:
- operational (day-to-day),
- policy (rules and constraints),
- constitutional (scope, commons boundaries).

Expertise MAY inform decisions but MUST NOT override:
- decision thresholds,
- facilitation rules,
- review and appeal processes.

Ecological expertise confers **input**, not authority.

---

## Labor, Contribution & Care

### Contribution Recognition

Ecological labor MUST be explicitly recognized.

The community SHOULD define:
- what counts as ecological work,
- how intensity, seasonality, and care labor are recorded,
- how contribution relates (or does not relate) to access and benefits.

Invisible ecological labor is treated as a structural defect.

---

### Outsourcing & Substitution

If ecological labor may be outsourced:
- equivalence rules MUST be explicit,
- financial substitution MUST NOT bypass participation requirements unless explicitly allowed,
- outsourcing MUST NOT create dependency on capital over contribution.

---

## Yield, Distribution & Surplus

The module SHOULD define:
- yield ownership and allocation rules,
- access priorities (if any),
- surplus handling and disposal.

Yield access MUST NOT silently replace membership or contribution obligations.

Food systems MUST NOT be used as leverage over participation or dissent.

---

## Infrastructure & Investment

Ecological infrastructure MUST have:
- explicit ownership classification,
- maintenance responsibility,
- funding and depreciation rules,
- decommissioning or transfer conditions.

Private investment into commons infrastructure MUST NOT grant control rights unless explicitly authorized.

---

## Conflict, Harm & Repair

Ecological conflicts MUST use Layer 4 processes.

The community SHOULD distinguish between:
- method disagreement,
- stewardship failure,
- boundary or authority violation,
- ecological harm requiring repair.

Repair obligations MUST be defined in advance and MUST be proportional.

---

## Artifacts

When adopted, the following artifacts are RECOMMENDED:
- Land & Ecology Scope Definition
- Land Use Map and Classification
- Stewardship Role Registry
- Ecological Contribution Framework
- Yield Allocation Rules
- Ecological Infrastructure Registry

Artifacts MUST be versioned and reviewable.

---

## Known Failure Modes (Informative)

This module is designed to resist:
- land capture through “those who care most decide,”
- burnout via invisible care work,
- ecological ideology becoming coercive,
- expert dominance replacing governance,
- irreversible land commitments without exit.

---

## Exit, Reversal & Deactivation

If this module is modified or removed:
- stewardship roles MUST unwind cleanly,
- ecological authority MUST revert to core governance,
- no permanent control claims MAY persist.

Ecological systems MAY continue.
Ecological power MUST NOT.

---

## Compatibility with RCOS Core

This module:
- MUST respect Layer 0 scope and invariants,
- MUST operate through Layer 2 governance,
- MUST align with Layer 3 economic rules,
- MUST use Layer 4 conflict pathways,
- MUST be documented via Layer 5,
- MAY evolve via Layer 6 change mechanisms.

Failure of this module MUST NOT destabilize RCOS Core.

---

## Non-Normative Note

Permaculture methods are intentionally excluded.

RCOS governs:
**who decides, who cares, who bears cost, who benefits, and how power is bounded** —
not planting techniques or ecological philosophy.
