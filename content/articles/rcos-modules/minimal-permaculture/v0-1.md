## Minimal Permaculture Module (Non-Normative)

This module defines the minimum structure required to integrate ecological care and food production into a very small RCOS-aligned community (typically 3–15 members).

Its purpose is to enable land care **without creating hidden ownership, invisible labor, or informal power**.

This module is intentionally minimal.

---

## Applicability

This module is suitable when:
- the community has fewer than ~15 members,
- ecological systems are small-scale,
- governance and operations are lightweight,
- formal specialization is limited.

If ecological systems become system-critical or scale significantly, this module SHOULD be replaced by the full Permaculture Module.

---

## Core Principles

- Ecology is infrastructure, not identity.
- Care does not imply control.
- No land or system becomes “someone’s” by default.
- Burnout prevention is more important than optimization.

---

## Governed Scope

The community MUST explicitly state:
- which land or systems are governed (e.g. garden, compost, water),
- which are informal or personal.

Anything not explicitly governed is out of scope.

---

## Stewardship Assignment

Ecological care MAY be assigned via:
- a single rotating steward role, or
- a shared caretaker agreement.

At minimum, the community MUST define:
- who is currently responsible,
- how long the responsibility lasts,
- how responsibility can be handed over.

No ecological responsibility may exist indefinitely without review.

---

## Labor & Contribution

The community MUST answer, explicitly but simply:
- Is ecological work expected of all members, optional, or role-based?
- Is substitution (money, outsourcing) allowed?

If labor is expected, care work MUST be:
- visible,
- discussable,
- renegotiable.

Invisible or morally coerced labor is a violation.

---

## Decision Authority

Day-to-day ecological decisions MAY be made by the current steward(s).

Structural decisions (e.g. expanding gardens, removing trees, locking land use) MUST:
- follow RCOS Layer 2 decision rules,
- be reviewable,
- be reversible where possible.

Expertise informs decisions but does not override process.

---

## Commons Protection (Minimal)

Land or systems used by the community:
- MUST NOT be privatized through care or investment,
- MUST remain reclaimable by the community,
- MUST have an exit path for both caretakers and non-caretakers.

If ownership exists, usage rights MUST be explicit.

---

## Failure Triggers

The following conditions REQUIRE review or escalation:
- one person becomes indispensable for ecological systems,
- care work causes recurring burnout,
- land use decisions become emotionally or morally coercive,
- exit from stewardship feels unsafe or punished.

---

## Artifacts (Minimal)

The following MAY be sufficient:
- a short Ecology Scope Note,
- a Stewardship Log (even informal),
- a simple labor agreement.

Excess documentation is discouraged.

---

## Compatibility

This module MUST NOT override:
- RCOS Layer 0 invariants,
- governance rules,
- exit rights.

Ecology may evolve.
Power must not.
