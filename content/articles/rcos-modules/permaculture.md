## Permaculture Module

The Permaculture Module is an optional, comprehensive module for communities that intend to **actively design, steward, and regenerate land as a core function of the community**.

It integrates ecological design with governance, economics, and long-term stewardship.

### What This Module Is

This module provides:
- A structured framework for regenerative land use
- Long-term stewardship principles
- Integration of food, water, soil, and habitat systems
- Clear governance interfaces for ecological decisions

It assumes that land is:
- Central to the community’s purpose, or
- A long-term commons requiring protection and regeneration

### What This Module Is Not

This module is not:
- A fixed design template
- A productivity mandate
- A replacement for local ecological knowledge
- A spiritual or ideological system

It does not enforce:
- Specific crops or techniques
- Aesthetic preferences
- Uniform levels of intensity or scale

### When to Use the Permaculture Module

This module is appropriate when:
- Land stewardship is mission-critical
- The community holds land long-term
- Food, water, or ecosystem services are core objectives
- There is capacity for design, maintenance, and learning
- Ecological failure would threaten community survival

It is especially relevant for:
- Rural communities
- Eco-villages
- Regenerative farms
- Land-based commons
- Multi-generational projects

### For Whom This Module Is Designed

This module is designed for:
- Communities with committed land stewards
- Groups willing to invest in ecological learning
- Communities coordinating shared land use
- Projects prioritizing long-term resilience over short-term convenience

### Typical Components

A full permaculture module may include:
- Land-use zoning and access rules
- Soil regeneration strategies
- Water capture and storage systems
- Biodiversity and habitat protection
- Integration with community economy
- Clear maintenance and stewardship roles

### Relationship to RCOS

This module:
- Extends Layer 3 (Economic & Resource System)
- Introduces stewardship roles in Layer 5
- May require safeguards (e.g. land anti-privatization)
- Must respect Layer 0 invariants and Layer 2 governance

Adopting this module implies a **long-term commitment** and SHOULD be paired with appropriate safeguards and exit rules.

### Migration and Scaling

Communities MAY:
- Start with a Minimal Permaculture Module
- Gradually adopt this full module
- Adjust scope as land use and capacity evolve

The module is designed to scale with both land size and community maturity.
