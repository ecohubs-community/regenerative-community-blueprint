title: 7. Layer 5 — Operations & Coordination
parentId: e6de7a5d
order: 70
---

Layer 5 defines how daily work, coordination, and information flow function in practice.  
Its purpose is to ensure that operations remain legible, sustainable, and transferable, and do not collapse into informal hierarchy, dependency, or burnout.

## 7.1 Roles and Responsibilities

7.1.1 All ongoing responsibilities MUST be assigned to explicit, named roles rather than implicit expectations or informal agreements.

7.1.2 The community MUST maintain a **Role Registry** that includes, at minimum:
- Role name and purpose  
- Scope of responsibility and decision authority  
- Explicit boundaries and interfaces with other roles, circles, or domains  
- Eligibility criteria (if any)  
- Term length, rotation, or review conditions (if any)  
- Appointment, review, and removal process  

7.1.3 Each role MUST include an explicit accountability mechanism defining:
- How role performance is reviewed  
- How underperformance, overload, or role failure is handled  
- How handover and knowledge transfer occur  

7.1.4 No ongoing responsibility MAY exist without an explicit role, and no person MAY be held accountable for responsibilities not formally assigned to a role.

7.1.5 Temporary or ad-hoc responsibilities MUST be explicitly time-bounded and MUST NOT become ongoing without formal role definition.

## 7.2 Meeting System

7.2.1 The community MUST define explicit meeting types sufficient to support:
- Operations  
- Governance  
- Coordination and alignment  
- Reflection and learning  
- Conflict handling (as required by Layer 4)

7.2.2 Each meeting type MUST define, at minimum:
- Purpose and decision scope  
- Required vs optional participants  
- Cadence and duration boundaries  
- Facilitation role and selection or rotation process  
- Agenda structure  
- Documentation and publication requirements  
- Decision capture requirements where decisions are made  

7.2.3 Meetings MUST NOT exceed their declared decision scope or bypass authority boundaries defined in Layer 2.

7.2.4 Meeting load MUST be bounded, monitored, and reviewable as defined in Section 7.4.

## 7.3 Documentation and Information Flow

7.3.1 The community MUST define explicit documentation rules for decisions, roles, operations, and shared obligations.

7.3.2 Documentation rules MUST specify, at minimum:
- What information MUST be recorded  
- Where records are stored  
- Who has access to which records  
- Publication or notification timelines (if any)  
- Privacy boundaries and conditions for restricted access  

7.3.3 All decisions MUST be traceable to:
- Decision type and domain  
- Authorized role or body  
- Decision mechanism and threshold  
- Recorded outcome and effective date  

7.3.4 Critical operational processes MUST be documented such that continuity does not depend on tacit knowledge held by specific individuals.

7.3.5 Information flow MUST be designed to prevent gatekeeping, bottlenecks, or dependency on informal intermediaries.

## 7.4 Workload and Capacity Boundaries

7.4.1 Time, attention, coordination capacity, and emotional labor MUST be treated as finite and limited resources.

7.4.2 The community MUST define explicit workload boundaries, including:
- Limits on meeting load (frequency, duration, or total time)  
- Limits on role load (number of roles, scope, or expected hours)  
- Expectations for response times and availability (if any)  
- Mechanisms for renegotiation, relief, substitution, or redistribution  

7.4.3 Workload boundaries MUST be reviewable and adjustable through an authorized governance process.

7.4.4 Persistent overload, burnout risk, chronic non-participation, or dependency on over-functioning individuals MUST trigger review or repair processes as defined in Layer 4.

## 7.5 Operational Continuity

7.5.1 The community MUST ensure that no single individual is a critical single point of failure for core operations.

7.5.2 Core operational roles and processes MUST include:
- Documented procedures  
- Clear handover mechanisms  
- Backup or redundancy arrangements where feasible  

7.5.3 Operational continuity planning MUST be reviewed periodically.

## 7.6 Artifacts

7.6.1 The following artifacts are mandatory for Layer 5 compliance:
- Operations Manual  
- Role Registry  
- Meeting Templates  

7.6.2 Layer 5 artifacts MUST be:
- Explicit and unambiguous  
- Versioned  
- Accessible to all members, with clearly bounded privacy protections  
- Maintained as living documents with defined ownership and review cycles  

7.6.3 The Operations Manual MUST define, at minimum:
- Core operational processes relied upon by the community  
- Interfaces between roles, domains, and meeting types  
- Documentation locations and update procedures  

7.6.4 Meeting Templates MUST define, at minimum:
- Agenda structure  
- Notes and record format  
- Decision capture format where applicable  

## 7.7 Layer Invariants

7.7.1 Ongoing responsibilities MUST NOT exist without an explicit role.

7.7.2 Critical operational processes MUST NOT rely solely on individual memory, goodwill, or informal transmission.

7.7.3 Meeting load, coordination burden, and unpaid or invisible labor MUST be bounded and reviewable.

7.7.4 Information access rules MUST be explicit and enforceable.

## 7.8 Explicitness Rules

7.8.1 The following MUST be explicit:
- Roles and responsibilities  
- Operational authority boundaries and interfaces  
- Meeting types and scopes  
- Decision documentation rules  
- Information access and privacy boundaries  

7.8.2 The following MAY be explicit:
- Detailed meeting cadence beyond minimum constraints  
- Tooling choices for documentation and coordination  
- Role rotation or succession schedules  

7.8.3 The following MUST remain optional and out of scope:
- Personal work styles  
- Aesthetic or cultural preferences  
- Informal social coordination
