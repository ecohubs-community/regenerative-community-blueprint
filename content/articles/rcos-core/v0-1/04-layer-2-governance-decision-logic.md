title: 4. Layer 2 — Governance & Decision Logic
parentId: e6de7a5d
order: 40
---

Layer 2 defines how collective decisions are made, who is authorized to make them, and how authority is constrained. Governance under RCOS is designed to make power explicit, bounded, reviewable, and reversible.

## 4.1 Decision Types

4.1.1 All collective decisions MUST be classified into exactly one of the following decision types:
- Operational Decisions
- Strategic Decisions
- Constitutional Decisions

4.1.2 Operational Decisions concern day-to-day functioning and execution within existing rules.

4.1.3 Strategic Decisions concern long-term direction, allocation of significant resources, or creation/removal of major structures.

4.1.4 Constitutional Decisions concern changes to Layer 0 invariants, purpose, scope, or the governance system itself.

4.1.5 If a decision cannot be clearly classified, it MUST default to the higher-impact decision type.

## 4.2 Decision Mechanisms

4.2.1 Each decision type MUST have an explicitly defined decision-making mechanism.

4.2.2 Decision mechanisms MAY include, but are not limited to:
- Consent-based decision-making
- Majority vote
- Supermajority vote
- Delegated authority
- Randomized or rotational assignment

4.2.3 Decision mechanisms MUST specify:
- Eligible participants
- Decision thresholds
- Blocking or veto conditions, if any
- Time constraints

4.2.4 No informal or ad hoc decision mechanism MAY be used for collective decisions.

## 4.3 Authority Boundaries

4.3.1 All authority MUST be assigned to explicitly defined roles, circles, or bodies.

4.3.2 Authority assignments MUST include:
- Scope of authority
- Limits of authority
- Duration or term, if applicable

4.3.3 No individual or body MAY exercise authority outside its explicitly assigned scope.

4.3.4 Authority MUST NOT be derived from charisma, seniority, ownership, or informal influence.

4.3.5 Temporary or emergency authority MUST be explicitly defined, time-bounded, and subject to review.

## 4.4 Decision Matrix

4.4.1 The community MUST maintain a Decision Matrix as a core governance artifact.

4.4.2 The Decision Matrix MUST map, at minimum:
- Decision type
- Decision domain
- Authorized role or body
- Decision mechanism
- Approval threshold
- Escalation path

4.4.3 The Decision Matrix MUST be publicly accessible to all members.

4.4.4 Decisions made outside the Decision Matrix MUST be considered invalid.

## 4.5 Governance Protocol

4.5.1 The community MUST define a Governance Protocol describing the full lifecycle of a decision.

4.5.2 The Governance Protocol MUST include:
- Proposal submission requirements
- Review and deliberation process
- Decision execution
- Documentation and publication
- Appeal and review mechanisms

4.5.3 The Governance Protocol MUST define how conflicts between decisions are resolved.

4.5.4 All governance actions MUST be documented according to Layer 5 documentation rules.

## 4.6 Safeguards and Failure Modes

4.6.1 The governance system MUST include safeguards against:
- Concentration of decision power
- Informal vetoes
- Decision capture by subgroups
- Founder or role entrenchment

4.6.2 Governance mechanisms MUST allow for challenge and review without retaliation.

4.6.3 Persistent governance failures MUST trigger a formal review or constitutional process.

## 4.7 Artifacts

4.7.1 The following artifacts are mandatory for Layer 2 compliance:
- Decision Matrix
- Governance Protocol
- Authority Registry

4.7.2 Layer 2 artifacts MUST be:
- Explicit and unambiguous
- Versioned
- Accessible to all members

4.7.3 Absence, ambiguity, or systematic violation of Layer 2 artifacts MUST result in loss of RCOS-Core compliance.
