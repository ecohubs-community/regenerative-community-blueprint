This glossary provides **informative definitions** for key terms used throughout the RCOS specification.  
Glossary entries do not introduce new requirements and do not override normative sections.

**Accountability**  
The expectation that roles and members can be asked to explain actions, outcomes, and adherence to agreed rules, with defined review and correction mechanisms.

**Accountability Protocol**  
An artifact defining how violations, harms, or repeated failures are reviewed, documented, and addressed, including due process, safeguards, and escalation paths.

**Artifact**  
A documented, versioned object (e.g. protocol, registry, charter) adopted through an authorized process and used to operationalize RCOS layers.

**Authority Boundary**  
The explicit limits within which a role, circle, or body may make decisions or act.

**Change Protocol**  
An artifact defining how changes are proposed, reviewed, adopted, published, and rolled back, including decision type classification and emergency provisions.

**Commons**  
Resources governed collectively under explicit stewardship, access, and decision rules.

**Community**  
A group of people who voluntarily coordinate around a shared purpose within a defined scope and governance system.

**Compliance**  
The state of meeting all mandatory requirements of RCOS-Core across Layers 0–6.

**Conflict Resolution Ladder**  
A staged conflict process defining minimum resolution steps and escalation thresholds, from low-intensity repair to governance review and, if necessary, separation.

**Constitutional Decision**  
A decision that modifies Layer 0 purpose, scope, invariants, or identity constraints, or the governance system itself.

**Decision Matrix**  
A governance artifact mapping decision types and domains to authorized roles, mechanisms, thresholds, and escalation paths.

**Decision Type**  
A classification of decisions (Operational, Strategic, Constitutional) used to determine authority and process.

**Due Process**  
The minimum fairness guarantees required before restricting rights, applying sanctions, or triggering separation, including notice, review, and appeal pathways as defined.

**Emergency Change**  
A time-bounded change enacted under explicitly defined emergency conditions, requiring post-hoc review and ratification or rollback.

**Explicit**  
Written, adopted, accessible, and reviewable.  
Anything not explicit is treated as non-existent under RCOS.

**Explicitness Rule**  
The principle that mechanisms allocating power, risk, responsibility, or exit conditions must be written, adopted, and reviewable.

**Experiment**  
A time-bounded, reversible change adopted for learning and evaluation.

**Exit & Separation Protocol**  
An artifact defining voluntary exit, forced exit due process, and separation of assets, roles, access, and obligations.

**Governance Protocol**  
An artifact defining the decision lifecycle (proposal, deliberation, adoption, documentation, review) and how governance conflicts are resolved.

**In-Scope / Out-of-Scope**  
In-scope refers to people, assets, domains, and activities explicitly governed by the community. Out-of-scope refers to everything explicitly excluded or not declared in scope.

**Internal Economy Protocol**  
An artifact defining contribution recognition and any internal exchange mechanisms, including accumulation constraints and dispute correction.

**Invariant**  
A non-negotiable constraint that cannot be overridden while it is in force.

**Layer**  
A functional domain of RCOS that defines a specific aspect of community operation.

**Learning Log**  
An artifact capturing major failures, adaptations, reversals, and lessons learned, including triggers, affected artifacts, and outcomes.

**Member**  
A person who has explicitly entered the community through the defined membership process.

**Optional Module**  
A domain-specific extension that builds on RCOS-Core without altering its mandatory layers.

**Registry**  
An artifact that records a set of authoritative entries (e.g., roles, resources, membership states) with clear ownership, update rules, and version history.

**Reference Implementation**  
A real-world community that publicly documents its application of RCOS-Core.

**Role**  
An explicitly defined bundle of responsibilities, authority, and accountability, independent of the person holding it.

**Safety-Critical**  
A condition where physical, psychological, or child safety is at risk, requiring elevated safeguards and potentially immediate protective action.

**Sanction**  
A defined, documented restriction or corrective action applied through authorized process, proportionate to a violation and subject to review.

**Scope**  
The explicitly declared domains, assets, and activities over which the community exercises authority.

**Stewardship**  
Responsibility for care, maintenance, and governance of a resource within defined boundaries.

**Treasury**  
The set of shared resources, balances, obligations, and commitments held under collective rules.

**Treasury Ruleset**  
An artifact defining how treasury resources are held, spent, reported, audited, and constrained, including thresholds and conflict-of-interest rules.

**Transparency Exception**  
An explicitly defined, justified, time-bounded limitation on information access that still permits compliance auditing.

**Version History**  
An artifact recording which version is in force and documenting adopted changes, effective dates, and decision references.
