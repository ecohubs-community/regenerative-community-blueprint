## 0. Introduction

### 0.1 Purpose of RCOS

Defines a standardized, modular operating system for small, intentional communities focused on resilience, fairness, and regeneration.

### 0.2 Scope of the Core

This specification defines the **mandatory core layers** required for RCOS compliance. Domain-specific practices are excluded and addressed via optional modules.

### 0.3 Design Principles

- Constraint-based, not value-based
- Pre-commitment over improvisation
- Modular by default
- Human-scale
- Failure-tolerant

### 0.4 Definitions & Terminology

- Community
- Member
- Role
- Domain
- Commons
- Invariant
- Decision Type
- Compliance

## 1. RCOS Compliance Model

### 1.1 Compliance Levels

- RCOS-Core compliant
- RCOS-Core + modules (non-normative)

### 1.2 Explicitness Requirement

Any mechanism affecting power, resources, obligations, or exit `MUST` be explicit, documented, and reviewable.

### 1.3 Meta-Invariant

If it is not written and adopted, it does not exist.

## 2. Layer 0 — Identity & Scope

Layer 0 defines the constitutional identity of the community. It establishes what the community *is*, what it *is not*, and the non-negotiable constraints under which all other layers operate. No rule, decision, or practice in higher layers may contradict Layer 0.

### 2.1 Purpose Definition

2.1.1 A community MUST define exactly one primary purpose.

2.1.2 The primary purpose MUST describe the enduring reason for the community’s existence and MUST NOT be a short-term goal, project, or strategy.

2.1.3 The primary purpose MUST be stable across time and MUST only be changed through a constitutional decision as defined in Layer 2 and executed via the change process defined in Layer 6.

2.1.4 Secondary purposes MAY be defined, but MUST NOT conflict with or override the primary purpose.

2.1.5 No action, decision, or allocation of resources MAY materially contradict the stated primary purpose.

### 2.2 Scope Declaration

2.2.1 The community MUST explicitly declare the scope of what it governs.

2.2.2 The scope declaration MUST include, at minimum:
- Assets governed by the community
- Domains of decision-making authority
- Activities and responsibilities under collective control

2.2.3 The scope declaration MUST explicitly list what is out of scope.

2.2.4 Anything not explicitly declared as in scope MUST be treated as out of scope.

2.2.5 The community MUST NOT exercise authority over persons, assets, or domains that are declared out of scope.

### 2.3 Invariants

2.3.1 Invariants are constraints that define what MUST NOT be violated while they are in force.

2.3.2 Invariants MUST be explicitly listed and documented.

2.3.3 Invariants MUST apply across all layers of RCOS.

2.3.4 No decision, role, process, or emergency measure MAY override an invariant.

2.3.5 If a conflict arises between an invariant and any other rule, the invariant MUST prevail.

2.3.6 Invariants MAY only be changed or removed through a constitutional change process as defined in Layer 2 and Layer 6.

### 2.4 Identity Constraints

2.4.1 The community MUST declare any identity-level constraints that materially affect participation, behavior, or governance.

2.4.2 Identity constraints MAY include, but are not limited to:
- Ethical or behavioral boundaries
- Participation prerequisites
- Non-negotiable cultural or ecological constraints

2.4.3 Identity constraints MUST be testable and enforceable through defined processes.

2.4.4 Identity constraints MUST NOT be enforced implicitly or informally.

### 2.5 Artifacts

2.5.3 If Layer 0 artifacts are missing, ambiguous, or internally contradictory, the community MUST be considered non-compliant with RCOS-Core.

## 3. Layer 1 — Membership System

Layer 1 defines how individuals enter, participate in, and exit the community. It establishes the explicit relationship between the individual and the collective, including rights, obligations, and due process. No person may be treated as a member without passing through the mechanisms defined in this layer.

### 3.1 Membership States

3.1.1 The community MUST define explicit membership states.

3.1.2 At minimum, the following membership states MUST exist:
- Applicant
- Trial / Probationary Member
- Full Member
- Exited Member

3.1.3 Each membership state MUST have clearly defined rights, obligations, and limitations.

3.1.4 No individual MAY hold multiple membership states simultaneously.

3.1.5 No rights or obligations MAY be assumed outside of the individual’s current membership state.

### 3.2 Entry and Onboarding

3.2.1 Entry into the community MUST follow an explicit onboarding process.

3.2.2 The onboarding process MUST include:

### 3.5 Participation and Contribution

3.5.1 Participation expectations MUST be explicitly defined.

3.5.2 Acceptable forms of contribution MUST be listed.

3.5.3 Substitution of participation (e.g., outsourcing labor) MUST be explicitly governed.

3.5.4 Persistent non-participation MUST trigger an accountability process as defined in Layer 4.

### 3.6 Exit and Separation

3.6.1 Voluntary exit MUST be possible at all times.

3.6.2 Exit procedures MUST be explicit, documented, and non-punitive.

3.6.3 Forced exit MUST follow due process and be handled through Layer 4 mechanisms.

3.6.5 Asset, role, and responsibility separation MUST be defined prior to exit.

### 3.7 Suspension and Temporary Status

3.7.1 The community MAY define temporary suspension states.

3.7.2 Suspension conditions MUST be explicit, time-bounded, and reviewable.

3.8.3 Absence, ambiguity, or systematic violation of Layer 1 artifacts MUST result in loss of RCOS-Core compliance.

## 4. Layer 2 — Governance & Decision Logic

Layer 2 defines how collective decisions are made, who is authorized to make them, and how authority is constrained. Governance under RCOS is designed to make power explicit, bounded, reviewable, and reversible.

### 4.1 Decision Types

4.1.1 All collective decisions MUST be classified into exactly one of the following decision types:
- Operational Decisions
- Strategic Decisions
- Constitutional Decisions

4.1.2 Operational Decisions concern day-to-day functioning and execution within existing rules.

4.1.3 Strategic Decisions concern long-term direction, allocation of significant resources, or creation/removal of major structures.

4.1.4 Constitutional Decisions concern changes to Layer 0 invariants, purpose, scope, or the governance system itself.

4.1.5 If a decision cannot be clearly classified, it MUST default to the higher-impact decision type.

### 4.2 Decision Mechanisms

4.2.1 Each decision type MUST have an explicitly defined decision-making mechanism.

4.2.2 Decision mechanisms MAY include, but are not limited to:
- Consent-based decision-making
- Majority vote
- Supermajority vote

### 4.3 Authority Boundaries

4.3.1 All authority MUST be assigned to explicitly defined roles, circles, or bodies.

4.3.2 Authority assignments MUST include:
- Scope of authority
- Limits of authority
- Duration or term, if applicable

4.3.3 No individual or body MAY exercise authority outside its explicitly assigned scope.

4.4.2 The Decision Matrix MUST map, at minimum:
- Decision type
- Decision domain
- Authorized role or body
- Decision mechanism
- Approval threshold
- Escalation path

4.4.3 The Decision Matrix MUST be publicly accessible to all members.

4.4.4 Decisions made outside the Decision Matrix MUST be considered invalid.

### 4.5 Governance Protocol

- Governance Protocol
- Authority Registry

4.7.2 Layer 2 artifacts MUST be:
- Explicit and unambiguous
- Versioned
- Accessible to all members

4.7.3 Absence, ambiguity, or systematic violation of Layer 2 artifacts MUST result in loss of RCOS-Core compliance.

## 5. Layer 3 — Economic & Resource System

Layer 3 defines how value, resources, and obligations flow inside the community.  
Its purpose is to make economic power explicit, bounded, reviewable, and subordinate to governance, preventing hidden accumulation, dependency, or coercion.

### 5.1 Commons vs Private Resources

5.1.1 All resources within the declared governed scope MUST be explicitly classified as either **commons** or **private**.

5.1.2 The community MUST maintain a single, explicit, and versioned registry of governed resources, including at minimum:
- Resource name or unique identifier  
- Classification (commons or private)  
- Steward or owner (as applicable)  
- Access and use rules  
- Transfer, sale, or privatization constraints (if any)

5.1.3 Any resource not explicitly classified MUST be treated as **unclassified**, and the community MUST NOT allocate, encumber, monetize, or transfer it until classification is completed through an authorized decision.

5.1.4 For commons resources, the community MUST explicitly define:
- Stewardship responsibilities  
- The authorized decision-making body or role  
- Maintenance obligations

5.2.3 The community MUST NOT structurally depend on unpaid, invisible, or informal labor for system survival without explicitly defining corresponding obligations, recognition, or compensation mechanisms.

5.2.4 If internal economic units are used (e.g. time credits, points, tokens), the Internal Economy Protocol MUST define:
- Issuance rules  
- Transferability rules  
- Expiration, decay, or cap mechanisms (if any)  
- Fraud prevention, dispute handling, and correction mechanisms  
- Privacy and transparency rules for balances and transactions  

5.2.5 Contribution recognition MUST NOT create implicit decision authority, veto power, or governance influence beyond what is defined in Layer 2.

### 5.3 Treasury Management

5.3.2 Income sources and any external income interfaces MUST be explicitly defined.

5.3.3 Spending authority MUST be explicitly bounded through:
- Clear authority assignments  
- Thresholds by amount and/or category  
- Approval and escalation paths  
- Mandatory recordkeeping requirements  

5.3.4 Transparency MUST be the default for treasury balances, inflows, outflows, obligations, and commitments.

- Caps  
- Decay or expiration  
- Non-transferability  
- Redistribution or taxation mechanisms  
- Time-bounded validity  

5.4.3 Economic mechanisms MUST NOT allow members to bypass governance authority boundaries defined in Layer 2, including through purchasing influence, creating dependency, or converting economic power into informal decision authority.

5.4.4 The community MUST define reviewable indicators of economic concentration risk and an explicit mechanism to adjust constraints when such risks are detected.

### 5.5 Artifacts

5.5.1 The following artifacts are mandatory for Layer 3 compliance:
- Internal Economy Protocol  
- Treasury Ruleset  

5.5.2 Layer 3 artifacts MUST be:
- Explicit and unambiguous  
- Versioned  
- Accessible to all members (with explicit, bounded exceptions)  
- Adopted through an authorized governance process  

5.5.3 The Internal Economy Protocol MUST define, at minimum:
- Contribution categories and recognition mechanisms  
- Commons vs private boundaries and allocation rules  
- Internal units (if any) and accumulation constraints  
- External income interfaces (if any)

5.6.2 Resources declared as commons MUST NOT be privatized through informal, implicit, or unilateral action.

5.6.3 Contribution recognition MUST be explicit such that unpaid or invisible labor is not structurally required for system survival.

5.6.4 Economic mechanisms MUST prevent indefinite concentration of internal influence.

### 5.7 Explicitness Rules

5.7.3 The following MUST remain optional and out of scope:
- Attitudes toward wealth  
- Equal vs differentiated outcomes  
- Personal financial choices

## 6. Layer 4 — Conflict, Repair & Accountability

Layer 4 defines how the community responds when trust, coordination, or safety breaks down.  
Its purpose is to ensure conflicts are handled explicitly, fairly, and safely, while preventing abuse of power, normalization of harm, or silent exclusion.

### 6.1 Conflict Classification

6.1.1 The community MUST define an explicit conflict classification system that is known, accessible, and usable by all members.

6.1.2 At minimum, the classification system MUST include the following classes:
- Interpersonal conflicts (between individuals)

6.1.3 Each conflict class MUST explicitly define:
- Entry criteria (how a situation is classified into this class)
- Expected response priority and timelines (if any)
- Permitted and required resolution pathways
- Documentation requirements and privacy boundaries

6.1.4 Conflicts involving credible safety risks, coercion, abuse, or threats MUST be classified as **safety-critical** and MUST trigger elevated safeguards as defined in Section 6.3.

6.1.5 Misclassification or avoidance of classification MUST be treated as a process failure subject to review.

### 6.2 Resolution Pathways

6.2.1 The community MUST define a minimum conflict resolution process applicable to all conflict classes.

6.2.2 The resolution process MUST include a clearly defined **resolution ladder** with explicit escalation steps.

6.2.3 The resolution ladder MUST define, at minimum:
- How a conflict is raised, logged, and acknowledged
- How involved parties are notified and invited to participate
- How refusal, non-response, or withdrawal is handled
- How mediators or facilitators are selected, replaced, or declined
- Time-bounded expectations for each stage (where applicable)
- Documentation requirements and access rules
- A process for reviewing procedural failures or deadlock

6.2.4 The resolution process MUST be accessible without requiring social status, seniority, charisma, or informal proximity to decision-makers.

6.2.5 Unresolved conflicts MUST escalate through defined governance pathways without bypassing the Decision Matrix defined in Layer 2.

### 6.3 Safeguards

6.3.1 The community MUST define explicit safeguards for conflicts involving power asymmetries, dependency relationships, or safety risks.

6.3.2 Safeguards MUST include protections against retaliation for:
- Raising a concern
- Requesting mediation
- Providing testimony or evidence
- Participating in a review or appeal

6.3.3 Where a power differential exists between parties, elevated safeguards MUST be applied, which MAY include:
- Independent or external facilitation
- Separate intake, documentation, or communication channels
- Temporary suspension or limitation of role authority
- Additional evidence and review thresholds prior to sanctions

6.3.4 For safety-critical conflicts, the community MUST define immediate protective actions that may be taken prior to full process completion, which MAY include:
- Temporary separation measures
- Restricted access to shared spaces or resources
- Temporary role suspension
- Emergency escalation timelines

6.3.5 Safety safeguards MUST override participation rights, role continuity, and operational convenience.

- Reviewable and appealable

6.4.3 The framework MUST define, at minimum:
- Available sanction and repair types
- Preconditions and evidence standards
- Authorized roles or bodies for application
- Review and appeal mechanisms
- Conditions for restoring rights, roles, or participation

6.4.4 Separation, suspension, or removal actions MUST follow due process and MUST align with exit and separation rules defined in Layer 1.

6.4.5 Sanctions MUST NOT be applied through informal exclusion, social pressure, silence, or implicit withdrawal of rights.

6.4.6 Repair-oriented actions MUST be prioritized over punitive actions except in safety-critical cases.

### 6.5 Artifacts

6.5.1 The following artifacts are mandatory for Layer 4 compliance:
- Conflict Resolution Ladder

- Sanction and repair options with proportionality rules
- Appeals, oversight, and escalation paths
- Coordination with Layer 1 exit and separation processes

### 6.6 Layer Invariants

6.6.1 Conflict MUST be treated as a handled condition with defined pathways; ignoring, suppressing, or normalizing unresolved conflict MUST be considered a system violation.

6.6.2 Conflicts involving power asymmetries MUST trigger elevated safeguards.

6.6.3 Repair and restoration MUST precede punishment except where immediate safety is at risk.

6.6.4 Physical, psychological, and child safety MUST override participation rights, role continuity, and reputational concerns.

- Conflict classification system
- Minimum resolution and escalation process
- Safeguards and anti-retaliation protections
- Sanction, repair, and separation thresholds

6.7.2 The following MAY be explicit:
- Mediation styles or methodologies
- Facilitator selection preferences beyond minimum safeguards

6.7.3 The following MUST remain optional and out of scope:
- Emotional expression norms
- Therapeutic, spiritual, or ideological framing of conflict

## 7. Layer 5 — Operations & Coordination

Layer 5 defines how daily work, coordination, and information flow function in practice.  
Its purpose is to ensure that operations remain legible, sustainable, and transferable, and do not collapse into informal hierarchy, dependency, or burnout.

### 7.1 Roles and Responsibilities

Nothing in this section may override or weaken requirements defined in Layers 0–6.

### 9.1 Optional Modules

9.1.1 Optional Modules are domain-specific extensions that build on top of RCOS-Core without modifying its mandatory layers.

9.1.2 Optional Modules MUST:

9.1.6 A community MAY be RCOS-Core compliant without adopting any Optional Modules.

### 9.2 Reference Implementations

9.2.1 A Reference Implementation is a real-world community that publicly documents how it applies RCOS-Core.

9.2.2 Reference Implementations are **descriptive**, not prescriptive.  
They illustrate how RCOS can be instantiated, not how it must be instantiated.

9.2.3 A community MAY claim to be an RCOS Reference Implementation only if it:
- Is RCOS-Core compliant  
- Publicly documents its Layer 0–6 artifacts  
- Clearly indicates deviations, experiments, or extensions  

9.2.4 Reference Implementation documentation SHOULD include:
- Context and scale (size, location, purpose)

9.3.3 Failure Modes MAY include, but are not limited to:
- Informal power accumulation  
- Founder or land-owner dominance  
- Invisible or gendered labor dependency  
- Governance paralysis or meeting overload  
- Exit blockage or soft coercion

- Enable early detection in live communities  

9.3.5 Failure Mode documentation SHOULD reference which RCOS layers are intended to mitigate the pattern.

## 10. Compliance & Auditing

This chapter defines how RCOS-Core compliance is assessed and maintained.

### 10.1 Compliance Checklist

10.1.1 RCOS-Core compliance is binary: a community is either compliant or non-compliant.

10.1.2 Compliance MUST be evaluated per layer (Layers 0–6).

10.1.3 For each layer, the Compliance Checklist MUST verify:
- Presence of mandatory artifacts  
- Explicitness and accessibility of required rules  
- Adoption through authorized governance processes  

10.1.4 Partial compliance or “intent to comply” MUST NOT be considered compliant.

10.1.5 Optional Modules MUST NOT be included in RCOS-Core compliance evaluation.

### 10.2 Test Cases

10.2.1 Test Cases are structured scenarios used to validate whether RCOS mechanisms behave as intended.

10.2.2 Test Cases MAY be:
- Hypothetical scenarios  
- Historical community failures  
- Simulated stress tests  

10.2.3 Test Cases SHOULD cover, at minimum:
- Power concentration attempts

- Any mandatory artifact is missing  
- Layer 0 invariants are violated  
- Decisions are repeatedly made outside authorized governance structures  
- Exit is blocked or informally constrained  

10.3.2 Non-compliance MUST be explicitly acknowledged once detected.

10.3.3 A community MAY regain compliance only through:
- Corrective action  
- Formal adoption of missing or corrected artifacts  
- Documentation of remediation  

10.3.4 Claims of RCOS compliance MUST be withdrawn during periods of known non-compliance.

## 11. Versioning & Governance of the Standard

This chapter defines how RCOS itself evolves as a standard.

### 11.1 Standard Stewardship

11.1.1 RCOS MUST have an identifiable stewarding body or process.

11.1.2 The steward’s responsibilities MUST include:
- Maintaining the canonical specification  
- Managing version releases  
- Curating reference materials and learning  
- Protecting Layer 0 invariants of the standard itself  

11.1.3 The steward MUST NOT act as an enforcement authority over communities.

11.1.4 RCOS stewardship MUST prioritize clarity, stability, and real-world learnings over ideological purity.

### 11.2 Change Process

11.2.1 Changes to RCOS-Core MUST follow a defined change process.

11.2.2 The change process MUST include:
- Proposal submission  
- Public review and feedback period  
- Decision mechanism and authority  
- Versioning and publication  

11.2.3 Backward compatibility SHOULD be preserved where possible.

11.2.4 Breaking changes MUST be clearly marked and justified.

11.2.5 Superseded versions of RCOS MUST remain publicly accessible.

11.2.6 RCOS itself MUST model the same principles it requires of communities: explicitness, bounded authority, reversibility, and learning.
