**Failure Mode**

A member violates a strong cultural norm (e.g., eating meat in a vegan community).

**Layers Involved**

Layer 0 (Purpose & Scope), Layer 1 (Membership), Layer 4 (Conflict)

**Relevant Invariants**

* 0.2 Explicit governed scope  
* 1.1 No implicit membership rules  
* 4.4 Safety overrides participation

**Test Condition**

* Norm violation occurs.  
* Enforcement response is unclear or emotionally driven.

**Expected RCOS Behavior**

* Determine whether the rule is:  
  * a core invariant,  
  * a membership condition,  
  * or an out-of-scope preference.  
* Apply due process only if explicitly governed.

**Pass Criteria**

* Response aligns strictly with declared scope and membership rules.

**Fail Criteria**

* Punishment or exclusion without explicit rule basis.
