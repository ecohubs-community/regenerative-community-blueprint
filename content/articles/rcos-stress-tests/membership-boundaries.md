## Purpose

This category focuses on failures at the **edges of belonging**: who is in, under what conditions, and how one can leave.

## Failure Pattern

Failures arise when:
- norms are enforced without being declared,
- membership status is ambiguous,
- or exit becomes structurally impossible.

Boundary ambiguity often produces the harshest conflicts.

## Structural Risk

When membership rules are implicit:
- enforcement becomes arbitrary,
- conflict becomes personal,
- and trust collapses.

Communities may drift into coercion without intent.

## What Is Being Stress-Tested

- Explicit membership criteria
- Rights–obligations symmetry
- Entry, probation, and exit mechanisms
- Scope alignment between purpose and enforcement

## RCOS Expectation

RCOS requires that:
- membership is always explicit,
- no one is punished for violating undeclared rules,
- and exit remains possible without undue harm.

This category tests whether belonging is **chosen, not trapped**.
