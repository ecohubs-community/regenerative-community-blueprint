## Purpose

This category covers failures where **cultural, moral, or spiritual influence overrides governance mechanisms**.

## Failure Pattern

Symptoms include:
- decisions justified by belief or moral authority,
- deference to perceived wisdom,
- or conflation of ethical insight with decision power.

Influence quietly becomes command.

## Structural Risk

When belief outranks process:
- dissent becomes taboo,
- governance becomes opaque,
- and coercion is reframed as virtue.

These systems are resistant to correction.

## What Is Being Stress-Tested

- Separation of influence and authority
- Power asymmetry safeguards
- Decoupling of cultural roles from governance roles

## RCOS Expectation

RCOS requires that:
- spiritual or moral roles carry no implicit authority,
- governance decisions follow declared mechanisms,
- and belief cannot override structure.

This category tests whether meaning **coexists with consent**.
