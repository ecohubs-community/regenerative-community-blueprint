## Purpose

This category examines failures where **conflict is avoided, suppressed, or personalized** instead of structurally processed.

## Failure Pattern

Common signs include:
- unspoken tensions,
- moral pressure to maintain harmony,
- or pathologizing individuals rather than addressing causes.

Avoidance is often mistaken for maturity.

## Structural Risk

Unresolved conflict accumulates and eventually explodes as:
- sudden exits,
- factionalism,
- or moral crises.

Systems without conflict pathways fail silently.

## What Is Being Stress-Tested

- Mandatory conflict handling
- Escalation paths
- Accountability without blame
- Safety overrides

## RCOS Expectation

RCOS mandates that:
- conflict must enter a defined process,
- avoidance is not a valid state,
- and power asymmetries are acknowledged.

This category tests whether the community can **repair without denial**.
