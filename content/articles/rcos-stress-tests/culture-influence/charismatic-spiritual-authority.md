Spiritual or moral authority overrides governance.

**Layers Involved**

Layer 2 (Governance), Layer 4 (Conflict)

**Relevant Invariants**

* 2.2 Authority must be explicit  
* 4.2 Power asymmetry safeguards

**Test Condition**

* Spiritual roles are decoupled from governance authority.

**Pass Criteria**

* Influence does not equal power.

**Fail Criteria**

* Governance becomes belief-driven.
