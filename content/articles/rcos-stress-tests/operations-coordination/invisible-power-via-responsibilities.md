**Failure Mode**

A member gradually accumulates undocumented responsibilities, becoming indispensable.

**Layers Involved**

Layer 5 (Operations), Layer 2 (Governance), Layer 3 (Economy)

**Relevant Invariants**

* 5.1 Roles must be defined  
* 5.2 Operational knowledge is documented  
* 3.4 No unbounded accumulation of internal power

**Test Condition**

* Tasks and authority are person-bound, undocumented, and irreplaceable.

**Expected RCOS Behavior**

* Responsibilities must be formalized into roles.  
* Knowledge must be documented.  
* Role scope, term, and succession are enforced.

**Pass Criteria**

* No single individual holds undocumented system-critical power.

**Fail Criteria**

* Community functionality depends on informal, unaccountable roles.
