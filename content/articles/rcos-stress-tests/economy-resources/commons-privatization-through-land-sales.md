**Failure Mode**

The community sells land to members, undermining exit and constitutional rules.

**Layers Involved**

Layer 0 (Scope & Invariants), Layer 3 (Economy), Layer 1 (Membership)

**Relevant Invariants**

* 0.2 Explicit governed scope  
* 3.2 Commons protection

* 1.2 Exit must be possible

**Test Condition**

* Asset ownership changes contradict declared invariants.  
* Members cannot exit without losing rights or property.

**Expected RCOS Behavior**

* Sales must be blocked or governed by pre-declared rules.  
* Exit and resale conditions must exist *before* transfer.

**Pass Criteria**

* Commons status and exit rights remain intact.

**Fail Criteria**

* The community becomes structurally non-exitable.
