## Purpose

This category examines failures in **coordination, role clarity, and operational sustainability**. It focuses on how work is distributed, documented, and rotated over time.

## Failure Pattern

Common symptoms include:
- accumulation of undocumented responsibilities,
- reliance on irreplaceable individuals,
- burnout due to invisible labor,
- and uncontrolled growth without integration capacity.

These failures often appear functional—until the system breaks.

## Structural Risk

Operational opacity creates hidden power, fragility, and exhaustion.  
When roles and knowledge are person-bound, the community becomes:
- non-resilient,
- non-scalable,
- and dependent on goodwill rather than structure.

## What Is Being Stress-Tested

- Role formalization
- Knowledge documentation
- Capacity limits
- Sustainability of contribution over time

## RCOS Expectation

RCOS requires that:
- critical functions are role-bound, not person-bound,
- operational knowledge is documented,
- and workload is visible and governable.

This category tests whether the community can **operate without heroics**.
