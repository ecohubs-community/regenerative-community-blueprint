**Failure Mode**

One or two individuals consistently talk over others and dominate meetings.

**Layers Involved**

Layer 2 (Governance), Layer 5 (Operations), Layer 4 (Conflict)

**Relevant Invariants**

* 2.2 Authority must be explicit  
* 5.1 Roles must be defined  
* 4.1 Conflict must be handled

**Test Condition**

* Meetings occur where speaking dominance repeatedly shapes outcomes.  
* No formal facilitation role or enforcement mechanism exists.

**Expected RCOS Behavior**

* Facilitation is assigned as a role with defined authority.  
* Speaking dominance is treated as a governance/process violation, not a personality issue.  
* Escalation path is triggered if behavior persists.

**Pass Criteria**

* Decisions are traceable to agreed mechanisms, not speaking time.  
* Dominance is addressable through defined roles or conflict protocol.

**Fail Criteria**

* Influence remains informal and unaccountable.
