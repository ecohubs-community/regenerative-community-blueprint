## Purpose

This category covers failure modes where **power concentrates informally inside formal governance structures**. These failures typically emerge when authority exists socially or culturally but is not declared, bounded, or reviewable.

## Failure Pattern

Communities may appear to have decision processes, but outcomes are shaped by:
- dominance in speaking time,
- founder status,
- charisma,
- or informal subgroups.

Power migrates away from explicit mechanisms into personalities.

## Structural Risk

If left unaddressed, these failures lead to:
- erosion of legitimacy,
- disengagement by quieter members,
- and eventual governance collapse or splintering.

These failures are rarely malicious; they emerge from ambiguity.

## What Is Being Stress-Tested

- Explicit authority definitions
- Decision traceability
- Reviewability of outcomes
- Supremacy of constitutional rules over individuals

## RCOS Expectation

RCOS-compliant systems must ensure that:
- all authority is explicit,
- informal power has no binding effect,
- and decisions made outside defined mechanisms are invalid.

This category tests whether governance is **real**, not ceremonial.
