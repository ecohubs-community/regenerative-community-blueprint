**Failure Mode**

Rules are bypassed “temporarily” during crises.

**Layers Involved**

Layer 2 (Governance), Layer 6 (Evolution)

**Relevant Invariants**

* 2.3 Constitutional rules outrank urgency  
* 6.2 Changes are versioned

**Test Condition**

* Emergency decisions permanently alter structure without review.

**Expected RCOS Behavior**

* Emergency powers are predefined, logged, and sunset.

**Pass Criteria**

* Normal rules resume post-crisis.

**Fail Criteria**

* Crisis becomes a precedent.
