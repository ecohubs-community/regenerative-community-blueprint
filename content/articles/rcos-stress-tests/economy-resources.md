## Purpose

This category addresses failures where **economic resources distort participation, power, or fairness** within the community.

## Failure Pattern

Typical issues include:
- privatization of shared assets,
- substitution of money for participation,
- or conversion of wealth into informal authority.

These failures often masquerade as pragmatic solutions.

## Structural Risk

Unregulated economic dynamics undermine:
- commons integrity,
- exit rights,
- and contribution equity.

Over time, the community becomes extractive or class-stratified.

## What Is Being Stress-Tested

- Commons protection
- Contribution equivalence rules
- Separation of wealth and authority
- Exit and transfer conditions

## RCOS Expectation

RCOS-compliant systems must:
- explicitly define economic rules,
- prevent unbounded accumulation of power via resources,
- and preserve exitability.

This category tests whether money **serves the system rather than rules it**.
