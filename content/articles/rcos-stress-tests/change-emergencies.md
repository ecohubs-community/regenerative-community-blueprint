## Purpose

This category examines failures triggered by **urgency, crisis, or rapid change**, where rules are bypassed “temporarily”.

## Failure Pattern

Typical cases involve:
- emergency decisions without limits,
- structural changes without review,
- or precedents created under pressure.

Temporary exceptions become permanent facts.

## Structural Risk

Without safeguards, crises are used to:
- centralize power,
- suspend accountability,
- or rewrite rules implicitly.

The system never fully recovers.

## What Is Being Stress-Tested

- Emergency powers
- Sunset clauses
- Versioning and review
- Restoration of normal governance

## RCOS Expectation

RCOS-compliant systems must:
- predefine emergency authority,
- log and review all exceptions,
- and explicitly revert post-crisis.

This category tests whether change is **governed, not reactive**.
