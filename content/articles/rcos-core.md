## What RCOS Is

The **Regenerative Community Operating System (RCOS)** is a formal, layered specification for designing, operating, and evolving intentional communities without relying on charisma, ideology, or informal power.

RCOS treats a community as a **governed system**, not a social experiment. It defines the minimum structural requirements needed for a community to remain:

- coherent under stress,
- fair under power asymmetries,
- adaptable without collapse,
- and regenerative over time.

RCOS is not a lifestyle, belief system, or cultural identity. It is an **operating system**: a set of explicit rules, interfaces, invariants, and test cases that make community life legible, auditable, and survivable.

---

## What Problem RCOS Solves

Most communities do not fail because of bad intentions. They fail because of **implicit structure**.

Common failure patterns include:

- informal leaders overriding formal processes,
- unspoken norms enforced as rules,
- invisible labor leading to burnout,
- wealth or charisma turning into power,
- conflict being avoided until it becomes existential,
- emergency decisions becoming permanent exceptions.

RCOS exists to make these failure modes **structurally impossible or explicitly addressable**.

---

## What RCOS Is Not

RCOS explicitly does **not** prescribe:

- a specific culture, belief, or spirituality,
- a political or economic ideology,
- a governance method (e.g. consensus vs sociocracy),
- or how people _should_ live together.

Instead, RCOS constrains _how choices are made_, _how power is bounded_, and _how change occurs_, regardless of values.

## Design Principles (Non-negotiable)

> **Nothing essential may remain implicit.**

- **Constraint-based, not value-based** — Defines rules and boundaries instead of prescribing beliefs. Values vary; constraints keep systems functional under stress.
- **Pre-commitment over improvisation** — Critical decisions (conflict, power, money) are agreed before emotions, scarcity, or power struggles arise.
- **Modular by default** — The core remains stable while optional domain modules can be added, replaced, or removed without breaking the system.
- **Human-scale (≈ 5–150 people)** — Optimized for groups small enough to maintain trust, accountability, and shared context without bureaucracy.
- **Failure-tolerant, not failure-blind** — Assumes conflict, burnout, and mistakes will happen and provides explicit recovery paths.

Anything that affects the following must be explicitly declared, versioned, and reviewable:

- authority
- membership
- resources
- conflict
- system evolution

- Silence is never treated as consent.
- Tradition is never treated as authority.
- Urgency is never treated as justification.

## On Group Size: Why ~150?

**150** ≈ Dunbar’s Number: cognitive limit for stable social relationships.

- **Minimum viable community (5–7 people):**
  Below this, role separation and conflict resolution collapse.
- **Optimal horizontal range (8–40 people):**
  High trust, low bureaucracy, direct participation possible.
- **Maximum unsegmented size (120–150 people):**
  Beyond this, informal governance fails.

RCOS Core applies to any size, but above ~150 people, mandatory sub-structures (circles, domains, neighborhoods) are required.

---

## Why the RCOS Core Structure Matters

- Prevents founder dominance
- Makes power explicit
- Reduces hidden norms
- Survives conflict
- Enables replication
- Integrates cleanly with DAO tooling, _without being dependent on it_

---

## What Is Deliberately Not in the RCOS Core

These belong to **optional modules**, not the core:

- Permaculture design
- Education philosophy
- Spiritual or cultural practices
- Political ideology
- Aesthetic or lifestyle choices

The core governs how decisions are made, not what decisions must be made.

---

## Invariants (Applies to All Layers)

### Explicit Beats Implicit

If it is not written, agreed, and versioned, **it does not exist**.

### Why This Matters

The Layer-Invariants ensure that no amount of goodwill, charisma, urgency, or consensus can quietly erode the system.

---

## The RCOS Explicitness Rule (Core Principle)

**Anything that allocates power, risk, responsibility, or exit conditions must be explicit.**

Anything that expresses preference, style, or local optimization may be optional.

### Explicit vs Optional by Layer

We use three categories:

- **MUST be explicit** → required for RCOS compliance
- **MAY be explicit** → recommended but context-dependent
- **MUST remain optional** → never enforced by the core

### Cross-layer Invariant on Explicitness

**If something can:**

- Remove someone’s rights
- Bind someone’s time or labor
- Control shared resources
- Silence dissent
- Prevent exit

**Then it must be explicit, documented, and reviewable.**

No exceptions.

This approach ensures:

- RCOS does **not** become bureaucratic
- Communities retain cultural freedom
- Only _structural risk_ is regulated
- Optional modules stay powerful, not constrained

---

## Stress-Test Driven Design

RCOS is validated not by intention but by **failure resistance**.

The specification includes a growing suite of **stress tests** derived from real community
collapses, such as:

- dominance in meetings
- founder veto power
- privatization of commons
- conflict avoidance cultures
- charismatic spiritual authority
- emergency rule bypasses

A community is considered RCOS-aligned only if it can **withstand these scenarios without informal fixes**.

Almost every failure happens because:

**Something powerful was allowed to remain implicit.**

RCOS turns:

- Implicit power → explicit roles
- Implicit values → scoped rules
- Implicit punishment → due process
- Implicit ownership → declared rights

## Reference Implementations

RCOS encourages small, real-world **reference communities** that:

- implement the core layers explicitly,
- document deviations and failures,
- and publish learnings back into the standard.

The goal is not perfection, but **evolution through transparency**.

---

## Why “Regenerative”

RCOS uses the term _regenerative_ deliberately.

A regenerative system:

- does not rely on constant growth,
- does not burn out its members,
- repairs damage instead of hiding it,
- and becomes stronger by integrating failure.

RCOS is designed so that **stress produces learning**, not collapse.

---

## Who RCOS Is For

RCOS is intended for:

- intentional communities,
- eco-villages and co-housing projects,
- cooperatives and commons-based organizations,
- long-term collective living experiments,
- and any group that wants to survive its own success.

RCOS is especially useful for groups that already share strong values — and want to ensure those values do not become tools of coercion.

---

## How to Use RCOS

RCOS can be used as:

- a **design blueprint** before founding a community,
- an **audit framework** for existing groups,
- a **stress-testing tool** during conflict,
- or a **shared language** for difficult structural conversations.

Adoption can be incremental. Compliance can be partial. What matters is **explicitness, not purity**.

---

## The Core Claim

> Communities do not fail because people are flawed.  
> They fail because systems are vague.

RCOS exists to replace vagueness with structure —  
so that care, autonomy, and regeneration have something solid to stand on.
