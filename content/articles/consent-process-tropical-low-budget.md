## Introduction

Consent-based decision making is particularly well-suited for **tropical, low-budget communities** that prioritize harmony and sustainable living.

## Key Principles

### 1. **Inclusive Participation**
- All community members have a voice
- Decisions are made through *consent*, not consensus
- Focus on "good enough for now, safe enough to try"

### 2. **Adaptive Governance**
- Flexible structures that evolve with community needs
- Low-cost implementation methods
- Climate-appropriate practices

## Implementation Steps

1. **Establish Circle Structure**
   - Form small working groups (5-7 people)
   - Define roles and responsibilities
   - Create meeting rhythms

2. **Consent Process**
   - Proposals are presented to the circle
   - Objectives are raised for specific reasons
   - Modifications are made collaboratively

> **Note:** This approach works particularly well in tropical climates where community cooperation is essential for resilience.

## Benefits

- ✅ Faster decision making
- ✅ Higher engagement
- ✅ Better adaptation to local conditions
- ✅ Minimal resource requirements

## Conclusion

Consent decision-making provides a **sustainable framework** for tropical communities to thrive while maintaining harmony and effective governance.
