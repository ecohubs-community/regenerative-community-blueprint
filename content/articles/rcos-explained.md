## **Design principles (non-negotiable)**

* **Constraint-based, not value-based**\
  Defines rules and boundaries instead of prescribing beliefs. Values vary; constraints keep systems functional under stress.
* **Pre-commitment over improvisation**\
  Critical decisions (conflict, power, money) are agreed before emotions, scarcity, or power struggles arise.
* **Modular by default**\
  The core remains stable while optional domain modules can be added, replaced, or removed without breaking the system.
* **Human-scale (≈ 5–150 people)**\
  Optimized for groups small enough to maintain trust, accountability, and shared context without bureaucracy.
* **Failure-tolerant, not failure-blind**\
  Assumes conflict, burnout, and mistakes will happen and provides explicit recovery paths.

## **On Group size: why \~150?**

**150** ≈ Dunbar’s Number: cognitive limit for stable social relationships.

* **Minimum viable community (5–7 people):**\
  Below this, role separation and conflict resolution collapse.
* **Optimal horizontal range (8–40 people):**\
  High trust, low bureaucracy, direct participation possible.
* **Maximum unsegmented size (120–150 people)**\
  Beyond this, informal governance fails.

RCOS Core applies to any size, but above \~150 people, mandatory sub-structures (circles, domains, neighborhoods) are required

## **Why the RCOS Core structure matters**

* Prevents founder dominance
* Makes power explicit
* Reduces hidden norms
* Survives conflict
* Enables replication
* Integrates cleanly with DAO tooling *without being dependent on it*

## **What is deliberately NOT in the RCOS Core**

These belong to **optional modules**, not the core:

* Permaculture design
* Education philosophy
* Spiritual or cultural practices
* Political ideology
* Aesthetic or lifestyle choices

The core governs how decisions are made, not what decisions must be made.

## **About Invariants (applies to all layers)**

### **Explicit beats implicit**

If it is not written, agreed, and versioned, **it does not exist**.

### **Why this matters**

The Layer-Invariants ensure that no amount of goodwill, charisma, urgency, or consensus can quietly erode the system.

## **The RCOS Explicitness Rule (core principle)**

**Anything that allocates power, risk, responsibility, or exit conditions must be explicit.**\
Anything that expresses preference, style, or local optimization may be optional.

### **Explicit vs Optional by Layer**

We use three categories:

* **MUST be explicit** → required for RCOS compliance
* **MAY be explicit** → recommended but context-dependent
* **MUST remain optional** → never enforced by the core

### **Cross-layer invariant on explicitness**

**If something can:**

* Remove someone’s rights
* Bind someone’s time or labor
* Control shared resources
* Silence dissent
* Prevent exit

→ **it must be explicit, documented, and reviewable**

No exceptions.

This approach ensures:

* RCOS does **not** become bureaucratic
* Communities retain cultural freedom
* Only *structural risk* is regulated
* Optional modules stay powerful, not constrained

## **RCOS Failure Catchment**

Almost every failure happens because:

**Something powerful was allowed to remain implicit.**

RCOS turns:

* Implicit power → explicit roles
* Implicit values → scoped rules
* Implicit punishment → due process
* Implicit ownership → declared rights
