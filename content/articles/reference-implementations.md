title: Reference Implementations
parentId: null
order: 0

This article documents **real-world communities that apply RCOS** in practice.

Reference implementations are not presented as ideal or complete. Their purpose is to make RCOS **observable, testable, and learnable** in lived environments.

An implementation may be partial, evolving, or experimental. What matters is that the structure is explicit and that deviations from RCOS are documented rather than hidden.

## Purpose of Reference Implementations

Reference implementations serve four core functions:

1. **Validation**  
   Demonstrate that RCOS can be applied outside theory.

2. **Learning**  
   Capture what works, what breaks, and why.

3. **Calibration**  
   Identify ambiguities, missing constraints, or over-engineering in the spec.

4. **Signal**  
   Allow others to see how RCOS looks in practice before adopting it.

This section is intentionally transparent and non-marketing.

## What Is Displayed Here

Each reference implementation SHOULD publish a concise, structured profile including:

### Community Overview
- Name of the community or project
- Location (country / region; exact address optional)
- Community size (current and target)
- Context (rural, urban, co-housing, eco-village, digital-first, etc.)

### RCOS Adoption Scope
- RCOS version adopted
- Layers implemented (0–6)
- Layers partially implemented or excluded (with rationale)
- Date of initial adoption

### Structural Artifacts
Links or references to:
- Purpose Charter and Scope Declaration
- Membership rules
- Governance protocols
- Role registry
- Conflict handling mechanisms
- Change / versioning protocol

Sensitive content MAY be redacted, but structure SHOULD remain visible.

### Known Deviations
Explicit list of:
- RCOS rules not followed
- Invariants under tension
- Temporary exceptions or experiments
- Legacy constraints

Honest deviation reporting is a strength, not a failure.

### Stress-Test Outcomes (Optional)
If applicable, brief notes on:
- RCOS stress tests encountered
- Which mechanisms held
- Which failed and why
- Structural changes made as a result

## What This Section Is Not

This section is explicitly **not**:
- a certification list,
- a ranking system,
- a showcase of “successful” communities,
- or an endorsement of values, culture, or ideology.

Presence here does not imply RCOS compliance or approval.

---

## How to Be Listed

Communities applying RCOS — fully or partially — are invited to be listed.

To request inclusion, provide:
- Community name or pseudonym
- Public or semi-public documentation links (if available)
- RCOS layers currently implemented
- Willingness level to share learnings (public / semi-public / anonymized)

Incomplete or early-stage implementations are welcome.

---

## Contact & Submission

If your community is experimenting with RCOS and would like to be included as a reference implementation, please contact:

**Email:** rcos@ecohubs.community  
**Subject:** “RCOS Reference Implementation”

If privacy or safety is a concern, anonymized or abstracted listings can be arranged.

## Why This Matters

RCOS is not meant to remain static or theoretical.

This section exists so that:
- real communities can influence the spec,
- failures can improve the system,
- and future communities can learn without repeating the same mistakes.

RCOS evolves through practice — not opinion.
