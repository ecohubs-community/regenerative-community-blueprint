**What problem does this community exist to solve?**

### **Purpose**

* **Primary purpose (singular)**
* **Secondary purposes (bounded)**

### **Scope**

Defines what the community governs and is responsible for.\
Purpose: prevent silent scope creep and power confusion.

* **Physical assets (land, buildings)**
* **Shared infrastructure**
* **Economic activities**
* **Legal entities**
* **Geographic or digital boundaries**

### **Invariants**

Explicitly defined non-negotiables.\
Purpose: create hard limits that even consensus cannot override casually.

* **What *cannot* be changed without dissolution or reboot**

### **Examples**

* “Land cannot be sold”
* “This community is non-speculative”
* “Children’s safety rules override all other decisions”

### **Artifacts**

* Purpose Charter
  * Primary purpose (1 sentence)
  * Secondary purposes (bounded list)
  * Conditions for changing purpose
* Scope Declaration
  * What is inside governance
  * What is outside governance
  * Interfaces with the external world

### **Layer Invariants**

* **Invariant 0.1: Single primary purpose**\
  A community must have exactly one primary purpose at any given time.
* **Invariant 0.2: Explicit governed scope**\
  All assets, domains, and responsibilities under community governance must be explicitly declared.
* **Invariant 0.3: Declared non-governed space**\
  Anything not listed as “in scope” is explicitly *out of scope* and not subject to community authority.
* **Invariant 0.4: Protected invariants**\
  Declared invariants cannot be changed without following the highest constitutional threshold or dissolution.

### **Explicitness Rules**

#### **MUST be explicit**

* Primary purpose
* Governed scope (assets, domains, authority)
* Declared invariants
* Conditions for purpose change

**Why:** ambiguity here creates silent power grabs.

#### **MAY be explicit**

* Secondary purposes
* External affiliations
* Long-term vision statements

#### **MUST remain optional**

* Ideology
* Spiritual framing
* Cultural narratives
