**How decisions are made, changed, and enforced.**

### **Decision types**

* **Operational**\
  Day-to-day decisions; reversible; low risk.
* **Strategic**\
  Medium-term direction; resource allocation; partially reversible.
* **Constitutional**\
  Changes to core rules, purpose, or invariants; high threshold.

### **Mechanisms**

How a decision is made.\
**Purpose:** match decision risk to decision method.

* Consent (no reasoned objection)
* Vote (majority / supermajority)
* Delegation (role-based authority)
* Proposal + review + adoption

### **Authority boundaries**

Who can decide.\
**Purpose:** avoid decision paralysis and power leakage.

* **Individual** – autonomy within role
* **Role** – defined responsibilities
* **Circle / Domain** – scoped authority
* **Whole community** – constitutional matters

### **Artifacts**

* Decision Matrix
  * Prevents arguments about *how* to decide
  * Makes authority explicit
  * Reduces emotional escalation
* Governance Protocol (short law document)
  * Decision types & thresholds
  * Roles and domains
  * Proposal lifecycle
  * Escalation and appeal paths
  * Emergency powers (if any)

### **Layer Invariants**

* **Invariant 2.1: Decision type precedes decision content**\
  How a decision is made must be agreed *before* what is decided.
* **Invariant 2.2: Authority must be explicit**\
  No one may exercise decision power without a defined role, mandate, or consent.
* **Invariant 2.3: Constitutional rules outrank all others**\
  Operational or strategic decisions cannot override constitutional agreements.
* **Invariant 2.4: Decisions are reviewable**\
  All decisions must be traceable to their authority, method, and record.

### **Explicitness Rules**

#### **MUST be explicit**

* Decision types (operational / strategic / constitutional)
* Who decides what (authority boundaries)
* Decision mechanisms and thresholds
* Escalation paths

**Why:** governance ambiguity equals informal hierarchy.

#### **MAY be explicit**

* Meeting facilitation style
* Proposal templates
* Emergency procedures

#### **MUST remain optional**

* Governance philosophy (consensus vs sociocracy, etc.)
* Emotional tone of meetings
