**Who is inside the system, and under what conditions?**

### Membership lifecycle

* Entry criteria  
* Trial / probation  
* Full membership  
* Exit (voluntary & forced)

### Rights vs obligations

* Decision rights  
* Resource access  
* Contribution expectations

### Artifacts

* Membership Agreement  
* Exit & Separation Protocol

### Layer Invariants

* **Invariant 1.1: No implicit membership**  
  Membership status must be explicit, documented, and mutually acknowledged.

* **Invariant 1.2: Entry and exit are always possible**  
  No member can be trapped indefinitely; exit paths must exist and be defined.

* **Invariant 1.3: Rights and obligations symmetry**  
  No rights without obligations, no obligations without corresponding rights.

* **Invariant 1.4: Due process for forced exit**  
  Removal of membership requires a predefined, documented process

### Explicitness Rules

#### **MUST be explicit**

* Membership states (trial, full, exited)  
* Entry and exit processes  
* Rights vs obligations  
* Forced exit due process

**Why:** unclear membership is the #1 source of abuse and burnout.

#### **MAY be explicit**

* Contribution expectations per role  
* Time commitments  
* Behavioral norms

#### **MUST remain optional**

* Personality fit criteria  
* Lifestyle choices  
* Belief alignment (unless legally required)
