**How value flows inside the community.**

### **Contribution recognition**

* Labor
* Care
* Knowledge
* Stewardship

### **Resource allocation**

* Commons vs private
* Internal exchange
* External income interface

### **Treasury logic**

* Transparency rules
* Spending authority
* Reserves & risk

### **Artifacts**

* Internal Economy Protocol (Defines how contributions are recognized and exchanged; non-monetary or token-based, but must be explicit)
  * What counts as contribution
  * How contributions are logged or acknowledged
  * Internal units (time credits, EcoTokens, points)
  * Commons vs private boundaries
  * Limits on accumulation
* Treasury Ruleset (Defines how shared resources are held and spent; “community financial law”)
  * Income sources
  * Spending authority by amount
  * Transparency requirements
  * Reserve policies
  * Risk and debt limits

### **Layer Invariants**

* **Invariant 3.1: Economic transparency by default**
  Shared resources, flows, and obligations must be visible to the community (with limited, explicit exceptions).
* **Invariant 3.2: Commons protection**
  Resources declared as commons cannot be privatized through informal or unilateral action.
* **Invariant 3.3: Contribution recognition is explicit**
  Unpaid or invisible labor must not be structurally required for system survival.
* **Invariant 3.4: No unbounded accumulation of internal power**
  Economic mechanisms must prevent indefinite concentration of internal influence.

### **Explicitness Rules**

#### **MUST be explicit**

* What is common vs private
* How shared resources are allocated
* Spending authority limits
* Transparency rules
* External income interface

**Why:** money + ambiguity destroys trust faster than conflict.

#### **MAY be explicit**

* Contribution valuation models
* Internal units (tokens, hours, points)
* Budget categories

#### **MUST remain optional**

* Attitudes toward wealth
* Equal vs differentiated outcomes
* Personal financial choices
