**What happens when things break.**

### Conflict classification

* Interpersonal  
* Role-based  
* Structural  
* Ethical boundary violations

### Repair mechanisms

* Mediation  
* Restorative processes  
* Sanctions  
* Separation

### Protection

* Power abuse safeguards  
* Minority protection  
* Burnout prevention

### Artifacts

* Conflict Resolution Ladder  
* Accountability Protocol

### Layer Invariants

* **Invariant 4.1: Conflict is handled, not avoided**  
  All conflicts must have a defined resolution path; ignoring conflict is a violation.

* **Invariant 4.2: Power asymmetry is acknowledged**  
  Conflicts involving power differences require elevated safeguards.

* **Invariant 4.3: Repair precedes punishment**  
  Restorative processes must be attempted before sanctions, except in safety-critical cases.

* **Invariant 4.4: Safety overrides participation**  
  Physical, psychological, and child safety override all participation rights.

### Explicitness Rules

#### **MUST be explicit**

* Conflict classification  
* Minimum repair process  
* Protection mechanisms  
* Separation thresholds

**Why:** conflict avoidance is not neutrality; it’s structural failure.

#### **MAY be explicit**

* Mediation styles  
* Facilitator selection  
* Restorative practices

#### **MUST remain optional**

* Emotional expression norms  
* Therapeutic or spiritual framing
