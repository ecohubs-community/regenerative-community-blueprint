**How daily life and work actually function.**

### **Meeting system**

* Types
  * Operational (coordination)
  * Governance (decisions)
  * Reflection / retro
  * Conflict / mediation
* Cadence
  * How often each meeting happens
  * Duration limits
  * Who is required vs optional
* Documentation rules
  * What must be recorded
  * Where it is stored
  * Who can access it
  * What is private vs public

### **Roles & responsibilities**

* Role definition
* Term limits
* Rotation rules

### **Information flow**

* Transparency defaults
* Privacy boundaries

### **Artifacts**

* Operations Manual (how things run day to day)
* Role Registry (who holds which role, for how long)
* Meeting Templates (agenda, notes, decision records)

### **Layer Invariants**

* **Invariant 5.1: Roles must be defined**\
  Ongoing responsibilities cannot exist without a named role.
* **Invariant 5.2: Operational knowledge is documented**\
  Critical operational processes must not live only in people’s heads.
* **Invariant 5.3: Time and attention are finite resources**\
  Meeting load, coordination burden, and unpaid labor must be bounded.
* **Invariant 5.4: Information access rules are explicit**\
  What is transparent and what is private must be clearly defined.

### **Explicitness Rules**

#### **MUST be explicit**

* Roles and responsibilities
* Decision documentation rules
* Information access rules
* Operational authority

**Why:** undocumented operations concentrate power invisibly.

#### **MAY be explicit**

* Meeting cadence
* Tooling (Notion, Git, etc.)
* Role rotation schedules

#### **MUST remain optional**

* Work styles
* Aesthetic preferences
* Informal social coordination
